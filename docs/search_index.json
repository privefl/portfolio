["developing-an-international-network.html", "1 Developing an international network 1.1 Objective 1.2 Getting more visible 1.3 Retrospective thoughts 1.4 Conclusion", " 1 Developing an international network 1.1 Objective There are many advantages of having a large international network. For example, I can get opportunities of work and collaboration, I can share my open source work to give back to the community, I get motivation from people recognizing my work. I want to develop an international network in two different communities: that of programming language R (in priority) and that of the analysis of genetic data (‚ÄúPredictive Human Genetics‚Äù ‚Äì my thesis subject). In order to achieve this, I am trying to become more and more visible on the international scene in many different ways. 1.2 Getting more visible 1.2.1 Check this using Google Analytics and R In order to get a sense of who is interested in me and my work, I decided to follow the flow of people on my websites using Google Analytics. I can access Google Analytics API in R: library(tidyverse) library(lubridate) library(googleAnalyticsR) ga_auth(&quot;.httr-oauth&quot;) select(ga_account_list(), c(webPropertyName, websiteUrl, viewId)) webPropertyName websiteUrl viewId Advanced R course https://privefl.github.io/advr38book/ 172000044 Blog of the R user group in Grenoble http://r-in-grenoble.github.io/blog/ 152777290 My R blog https://privefl.github.io/blog 152155542 My website (About) http://privefl.github.io/about.html 153879696 1.2.2 Website and blog First, just before the beginning of my thesis, I created my personal website and my blog about R. I try to blog fairly regularly about R and my blog is relayed on R-bloggers, a platform that brings together ~750 R bloggers and is read by thousands of people internationally. More and more people are coming to by blog: data_blog &lt;- google_analytics( viewId = &quot;152155542&quot;, date_range = ymd(&quot;2016-10-01&quot;, Sys.Date()), dimensions = c(&quot;date&quot;), # , &quot;pagePath&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; metrics = c(&quot;sessions&quot;) # , &quot;pageviews&quot; ) #&gt; 2019-03-26 09:21:43&gt; Downloaded [907] rows from a total of [907]. # No data from Google Analytics before this date ga_begin &lt;- which(data_blog$date == &quot;2017-06-04&quot;) qplot(y = cumsum(data_blog$sessions)) + geom_vline(xintercept = ga_begin, color = &quot;red&quot;) + bigstatsr::theme_bigstatsr() + labs(x = &quot;Day of blogging&quot;, y = &quot;Cumulative numbers of session on my blog&quot;) 1.2.3 GitHub GitHub is a platform where you can put your code. GitHub is a good way to make your work visible internationally and facilitate collaborations. On GitHub, I‚Äôm trying to create useful R packages and contribute to other packages. 1.2.4 Twitter, an important tool for work I also try to be visible on Twitter, which is used by both communities that are of interest for me to communicate about new stuff. To convince you, two tweets about my R course: Teaching an advanced R course https://t.co/2pMG2FWcPs #rstats #DataScience ‚Äî R-bloggers ((???)) 30 mars 2018 If you are at the airport today waiting for your ‚úàÔ∏è, here's something good to read: ‚ÄúAdvanced #RStats Course‚Äù by (???) https://t.co/JXKBI5lON2 ‚Äî Colin Fay ((???)) 17 mai 2018 In parallel, let‚Äôs plot the number of visitors of my course: data_course &lt;- google_analytics( viewId = &quot;172000044&quot;, date_range = ymd(&quot;2018-03-20&quot;, Sys.Date()), dimensions = c(&quot;date&quot;), # , &quot;pagePath&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; metrics = c(&quot;sessions&quot;) # , &quot;pageviews&quot; ) #&gt; 2019-03-26 09:21:46&gt; Downloaded [372] rows from a total of [372]. ggplot(data_course) + geom_vline(xintercept = ymd(&quot;2018-03-30&quot;, &quot;2018-05-17&quot;), linetype = 2, color = &quot;red&quot;) + geom_point(aes(date, sessions)) + bigstatsr::theme_bigstatsr() Here, you can clearly see two peaks of visit of my advanced R course, one when I blogged about it, which was relayed by R-bloggers (59K followers), and the other peak when Colin Fay (4600+ followers) tweeted about it. 1.2.5 Attending conferences To develop an international network, it is also very important to attend conferences, which I‚Äôm also trying to do. Use bigstatsr #rstats package for matrices larger than 100GB. Great ‚ö° talk by (???) at (???) #erum2018 #DataScience pic.twitter.com/magBeDTyVz ‚Äî Peter Laurinec ((???)) 15 mai 2018 This is me on stage in Budapest in May 2018. Before this conference, I had 118 followers on Twitter; after 3 days of conference, I had 158 (+34%). I‚Äôve also presented my work elsewhere, such as in Paris and in Denmark. Back in üá´üá∑. I had a great time in üá©üá∞ meeting (???), (???), (???), T. Bataillon, (???) and others. Thanks (???) for everything.

[Recording] 1.2.6 A local network Finally, in addition to taking part in an international community, I think it‚Äôs very important to take part in a more local community. That‚Äôs one reason why I launched the initiative to make an R community in Grenoble, which started to be active in September 2017 (https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/). 1.3 Retrospective thoughts I‚Äôve invested quite some time in R because I didn‚Äôt want to continue in Research at first. Now, I‚Äôm starting to switch to the ‚Äúhuman genetics‚Äù community where I will possibly work. Maybe, I should have started earlier as it is hard to enter new research fields (since my thesis supervisors are not directly of this field). 1.4 Conclusion Thus, my international network is under development. I‚Äôm using my blog (2K active users each month), Twitter (300+ followers), GitHub (150+ stars), Stack Overflow (~84K people reached) and conferences to get people to know me and want to work with me. We can consider that it is a process that takes time, yet the indicators show that I am on the right track. It has already paid off for my career as I have already received 5 postdoc offers. I‚Äôm leaving for Denmark in May to meet and work with new people. And I‚Äôll will be lecturer in some Machine Learning for Health and Bioinformatics workshop. "],
["designing-teaching-materials.html", "2 Designing teaching materials 2.1 Content 2.2 Materials 2.3 All chapters 2.4 Retrospective thoughts 2.5 New year 2.6 Other teachings", " 2 Designing teaching materials Here, I come back to my first experience teaching an advanced R course (R is a programming language with a lot of users in Statistics / Data Science). 2.1 Content I planned this course in 10 sessions (of 3 hours each) for PhD students with some basics in R. I initially wanted to talk about the following subjects: R programming and good practices (2 sessions) Data analysis with the tidyverse (3 sessions) R code performance (2 sessions) R packages (2 sessions) Bonus: Shiny (1 session) I basically sticked to this. 2.2 Materials At first, I wanted to do an interactive course using package {learnr} but it would have required way too much work (my thesis supervisor would not have been happy!). So, I finally decided to use package {bookdown}. Using {bookdown} was really easy, and knowing how to use it now is useful (e.g.¬†this website is made with {bookdown}). Materials are available there. I also decided to create an associated package for many reasons: to make students install package dependencies that we needed in this course, to make data easily available to students, to make solutions available for the chapter on code performance. This idea of having a bookdown for materials with an associated package is not new (e.g.¬†see the Efficient R Programming book and its associated package). I started bookmarking materials and ideas 6 months before starting the course so that I could present many interesting things, and students could deepen their knowledge on some topics, even if we have time to only scratch the surface in class. I also bookmarked questions that had answered on Stack Overflow. I think these questions make good exercises because they come from real problem that other people have, the questions are short and well designed (with some data and code to reproduce the problem and some expected output), and I have already thought about a solution. Students were really happy with the materials. 2.3 All chapters I started the course with good practices such as coding style, using RStudio and Git, and getting help. I continued the course with some base R programming. This is not the funniest part of the course, but knowing this seemed to me as inevitable to be proficient in R. Then, we learned about the tidyverse using the R for Data Science book. While teaching this course, I have discovered that many people still don‚Äôt use {ggplot2} and {dplyr}, two packages that have been used by many people for more than 10 years. So, I had to introduce these two packages from scratch and it took me longer than I had anticipated. In 3 sessions (9h), I had the time to cover R Markdown, {ggplot2} and {dplyr} only. After the tidyverse, I covered performance of R code. I really like to solve performance problems on Stack Overflow and (I think) I‚Äôm really good at it. So, this may have been the chapter I could bring the most to the table. Moreover, one student came with one of the problem she had, and I used her problem as an exercise. At the end, she was able to make her code more than 1000 times faster. For the other exercises, I mainly used problems I had answered on Stack Overflow. For the last chapter, we covered how to make an R package. I showed them that it was really easy and fast, mainly thanks to packages {usethis} and {roxygen2}. We had time to cover the full documentation, testing, automatic checking of packages and even how to make a website of a package. Finally, the last session was a ‚Äúbonus‚Äù session we could use either to spend more time on any topic or just to learn something fun like {Shiny}. Indeed, we could have spent at least two more sessions on the tidyverse and one on practicing about performance of R code. Using a Slack poll, we agreed to learn Shiny. For this, I used this nice and free DataCamp course. 2.4 Retrospective thoughts At least half of the materials I used is borrowed from others. At first, I felt bad about this because I felt lazy. But it has already taken me a lot of time to prepare these materials, just reinventing the wheel with some new materials that were already out there would have not been good for me or my students. I think using {bookdown}, Git and Slack was a good idea. Indeed, using {bookdown} makes the structure of the course very clear. Moreover, other resources that I use are also in this format so that students are already familiar with it. Then, Git is so useful for everything related to code, so even if some students do not get the point of learning Git now, they will thank me later. And, it is really easy to learn Git in RStudio. Finally, Slack was really helpful to do many things such as sharing code or data to help students with their own problems and also to make some polls to choose between options (e.g.¬†choosing what to cover in the last/bonus session). I feel like I have covered lots of useful things. However, I would have wanted my course to be useful for more people (I had only 10-12 students). So, in order to get motivated to make these materials, I designed them to be used by other people anywhere in the world. library(tidyverse) library(googleAnalyticsR) ga_auth(&quot;.httr-oauth&quot;) data_course_country &lt;- google_analytics( viewId = &quot;172000044&quot;, date_range = lubridate::ymd(&quot;2018-03-20&quot;, Sys.Date()), dimensions = c(&quot;country&quot;), # , &quot;pagePath&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; metrics = c(&quot;sessions&quot;) # , &quot;pageviews&quot; ) sum(data_course_country$sessions) #&gt; [1] 4015 data_course_country %&gt;% mutate(country2 = ifelse(sessions &lt; 30, NA, country)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(country2, -sessions), sessions)) + geom_col() + scale_x_discrete(na.translate = FALSE) + bigstatsr::theme_bigstatsr() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + labs(x = &quot;Country&quot;, y = &quot;Number of sessions&quot;, title = &quot;Number of sessions by country&quot;) #&gt; Warning: Removed 73 rows containing missing values (position_stack). 2.5 New year I‚Äôm teaching this course again this year (2019). I was also teaching at ENSIMAG in the meantime, so that it is good that all materials were ready from last year since I would not have time to prepare them again. I have updated some small parts of the course, making sure that all code was still running, replacing exercises that were too hard, etc. I also decided to plan only 9 sessions in 3 weeks instead of 10 sessions in 5 weeks. Indeed, only one session of packages is sufficient and students from last year reported that a course over 5 weeks was too long. 2.6 Other teachings courses and practical exercises in Mathematics for first year college students (2 x 64H) advanced R course for PhD students (30H + 27H) introductory R course for PhD students (21H) statistical methods for first year engineer students (third year after high school) at ENSIMAG where I got my degree 3 years ago (18H) "],
