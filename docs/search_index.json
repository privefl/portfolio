External point of view I have read Florian Privé’s portfolio and once again I have been impressed by his achievements during his thesis. Florian was mature enough to think about how he could develop his international network. He has his own blog, website, he has his personal github webpage as well as an active Twitter and Stack Overflow account. He has been very active on social networks and has now connections all around the world, which can be useful whatever his next career move. Florian has also designed an original teaching material online to provide teaching about R, which is a statistical software. He started a new course from scratch, and collected materials online. He has been able to publish an original online advanced course about R that students can use to learn the R software. If Florian wants to be involved in teaching later in his career, he will build upon this previous experience of designing an online course. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about Florian. – Michael Blum, CNRS Director of Research. About Florian Privé is a PhD student in predictive human genetics, fond of Data Science and an R(cpp) enthusiast. He is also the founder and co-organizer of the Grenoble R user group. You can find him on Twitter and GitHub as @privefl and on Stack Overflow as F. Privé. "]
