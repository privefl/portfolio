For example, I can get opportunities of work and collaboration, I can share my open source work to give back to the community, I get motivation from people recognizing my work. I want to develop an international network in two different communities: that of programming language R (in priority) and that of the analysis of genetic data (‚ÄúPredictive Human Genetics‚Äù ‚Äì my thesis subject). In order to achieve this, I am trying to become more and more visible on the international scene in many different ways. 1.2 Getting more visible 1.2.1 Check this using Google Analytics and R In order to get a sense of who is interested in me and my work, I decided to follow the flow of people on my websites using Google Analytics. I can access Google Analytics API in R: library(tidyverse) library(lubridate) library(googleAnalyticsR) ga_auth(&quot;.httr-oauth&quot;) select(ga_account_list(), c(webPropertyName, websiteUrl, viewId)) webPropertyName websiteUrl viewId Advanced R course https://privefl.github.io/advr38book/ 172000044 Blog of the R user group in Grenoble http://r-in-grenoble.github.io/blog/ 152777290 My R blog https://privefl.github.io/blog 152155542 My website (About) http://privefl.github.io/about.html 153879696 1.2.2 Website and blog First, just before the beginning of my thesis, I created my personal website and my blog about R. I try to blog fairly regularly about R and my blog is relayed on R-bloggers, a platform that brings together ~750 R bloggers and is read by thousands of people internationally. More and more people are coming to by blog: data_blog &lt;- google_analytics( viewId = &quot;152155542&quot;, date_range = ymd(&quot;2016-10-01&quot;, Sys.Date()), dimensions = c(&quot;date&quot;), # , &quot;pagePath&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; metrics = c(&quot;sessions&quot;) # , &quot;pageviews&quot; ) #&gt; 2019-03-26 09:39:18&gt; Downloaded [907] rows from a total of [907]. # No data from Google Analytics before this date ga_begin &lt;- which(data_blog$date == &quot;2017-06-04&quot;) qplot(y = cumsum(data_blog$sessions)) + geom_vline(xintercept = ga_begin, color = &quot;red&quot;) + bigstatsr::theme_bigstatsr() + labs(x = &quot;Day of blogging&quot;, y = &quot;Cumulative numbers of session on my blog&quot;) 1.2.3 GitHub GitHub is a platform where you can put your code. GitHub is a good way to make your work visible internationally and facilitate collaborations. On GitHub, I‚Äôm trying to create useful R packages and contribute to other packages. 1.2.4 Twitter, an important tool for work I also try to be visible on Twitter, which is used by both communities that are of interest for me to communicate about new stuff. To convince you, two tweets about my R course: Teaching an advanced R course https://t.co/2pMG2FWcPs #rstats #DataScience ‚Äî R-bloggers ((???)) 30 mars 2018 If you are at the airport today waiting for your ‚úàÔ∏è, here's something good to read: ‚ÄúAdvanced #RStats Course‚Äù by (???) https://t.co/JXKBI5lON2 ‚Äî Colin Fay ((???)) 17 mai 2018 In parallel, let‚Äôs plot the number of visitors of my course: data_course &lt;- google_analytics( viewId = &quot;172000044&quot;, date_range = ymd(&quot;2018-03-20&quot;, Sys.Date()), dimensions = c(&quot;date&quot;), # , &quot;pagePath&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; metrics = c(&quot;sessions&quot;) # , &quot;pageviews&quot; ) #&gt; 2019-03-26 09:39:20&gt; Downloaded [372] rows from a total of [372]. ggplot(data_course) + geom_vline(xintercept = ymd(&quot;2018-03-30&quot;, &quot;2018-05-17&quot;), linetype = 2, color = &quot;red&quot;) + geom_point(aes(date, sessions)) + bigstatsr::theme_bigstatsr() Here, you can clearly see two peaks of visit of my advanced R course, one when I blogged about it, which was relayed by R-bloggers (59K followers at the time), and the other peak when Colin Fay (4600+ followers) tweeted about it. 1.2.5 Attending conferences To develop an international network, it is also very important to attend conferences, which I‚Äôm also trying to do. Use bigstatsr #rstats package for matrices larger than 100GB. Great ‚ö° talk by (???) at (???) #erum2018 #DataScience pic.twitter.com/magBeDTyVz ‚Äî Peter Laurinec ((???)) 15 mai 2018 This is me on stage in Budapest in May 2018. Before this conference, I had 118 followers on Twitter; after 3 days of conference, I had 158 (+34%). I‚Äôve also presented my work elsewhere, such as in Paris and in Denmark. Back in üá´üá∑. I had a great time in üá©üá∞ meeting (???), (???), (???), T. Bataillon, (???) and others. Thanks (???) for everything. I might come back later üòâ pic.twitter.com/gd06D9Ojqp ‚Äî Florian Priv√© ((???)) 17 janvier 2019 Conferences I presented at: Rencontres R 2018: The R package bigstatsr: Memory- and Computation-Efficient Statistical Tools for Big Matrices [Slides] eRum 2018: An R package for statistical tools with big matrices stored on disk. [Recording] [Slides] Recomb-Genetics 2018: Predicting complex diseases: performance and robustness. [Slides] LIFE 2018: Predicting complex diseases: performance and robustness. [Slides] hackseq 2017: Developing advanced R tutorials for genomic data analysis. [Website] useR!2017: The R package bigstatsr: Memory- and Computation-Efficient Tools for Big Matrices. [Recording] 1.2.6 A local network Finally, in addition to taking part in an international community, I think it‚Äôs very important to take part in a more local community. That‚Äôs one reason why I launched the initiative to make an R community in Grenoble, which started to be active in September 2017 (https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/). I‚Äôm also an active member in the French community; we have been gathering on Slack. 1.3 Retrospective thoughts I‚Äôve invested quite some time in R because I didn‚Äôt want to continue in Research at first. Now, I‚Äôm starting to switch to the ‚Äúhuman genetics‚Äù community where I will possibly work. Maybe, I should have started earlier as it is hard to enter new research fields (since my thesis supervisors are not directly of this field). 1.4 Conclusion Thus, my international network is under development. I‚Äôm using my blog (2K active users each month), Twitter (300+ followers), GitHub (150+ stars), Stack Overflow (~84K people reached) and conferences to get people to know me and want to work with me. We can consider that it is a process that takes time, yet the indicators show that I am on the right track. It has already paid off for my career as I have already received 5 postdoc offers. I‚Äôm leaving for Denmark in May to meet and work with new people. I will also be lecturer in some Machine Learning for Health and Bioinformatics workshop at King‚Äôs College London. "]
