# Developing an international network



## Objective

There are many advantages of having a large international network. For example,

- I can get opportunities of work and collaboration,

- I can share my open source work to give back to the community,

- I get motivation from people recognizing my work.

I want to develop an international network in two different communities:

- that of programming language R (~~in priority~~) and
 
- that of the analysis of genetic data ("Predictive Human Genetics" -- my thesis subject). 

In order to achieve this, I am trying to become more and more **visible on the international scene** in many different ways.

## Getting more visible

### Check this using Google Analytics and R

In order to get a sense of who is interested in me and my work, I decided to follow the flow of people on my websites using Google Analytics.

I can access Google Analytics API in R:


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(googleAnalyticsR)
ga_auth(".httr-oauth")
select(ga_account_list(), c(webPropertyName, websiteUrl, viewId)) 
```

<div class="kable-table">

webPropertyName                        websiteUrl                              viewId

### Website and blog

First, just before the beginning of my thesis, I created my personal website and my blog about R. I try to blog fairly regularly about R and my blog is relayed on R-bloggers, a platform that brings together ~750 R bloggers and is read by thousands of people internationally. 

More and more people are coming to by blog:


```r
data_blog <- google_analytics(
  viewId = "152155542",
  date_range = ymd("2016-10-01", Sys.Date()),
  dimensions = "date",
  metrics = "sessions"
)
```

```
#> 2019-04-05 09:33:17> Downloaded [917] rows from a total of [917].
```

```r
# No data from Google Analytics before this date
ga_begin <- which(data_blog$date == "2017-06-04")

qplot(y = cumsum(data_blog$sessions)) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = ga_begin, color = "red") + 
  bigstatsr::theme_bigstatsr() + 
  labs(x = "Day of blogging", y = "Cumulative numbers of session on my blog")
```

<img src="network_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

```r
avg_time <- google_analytics(
  viewId = "152155542",
  date_range = ymd("2017-06-04", Sys.Date()),
  metrics = "avgSessionDuration"
)
```

```
#> 2019-04-05 09:33:19> Downloaded [1] rows from a total of [1].
```

```r
cat("The average time for each session is", avg_time[[1]], "seconds.\n")
```

```
#> The average time for each session is 36.77148 seconds.
```


### GitHub

GitHub is a platform where you can put your code. GitHub is a good way to make your work visible internationally and facilitate collaborations. On GitHub, I'm trying to create useful R packages and contribute to other packages. 

### Twitter, an important tool for work

I also try to be visible on Twitter, which is used by both communities that are of interest for me to communicate about new stuff. For example, look at [this article in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00535-w) "How to use Twitter to further your research career" and [this blog post](https://academicpositions.com/career-advice/why-academics-should-use-twitter) "Why Academics Should Use Twitter".

To convince you, these are three tweets about my R course (topic of the next chapter):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Teaching an advanced R course <a href="https://t.co/2pMG2FWcPs">https://t.co/2pMG2FWcPs</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DataScience?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DataScience</a></p>&mdash; R-bloggers (@Rbloggers) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rbloggers/status/979539984679161857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">30 mars 2018</a></blockquote>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In parallel, let's plot the number of visitors of my course:


```r
data_course <- google_analytics(
  viewId = "172000044",
  date_range = ymd("2018-03-20", Sys.Date()),
  dimensions = c("date"),  # , "pagePath", "hour", "medium"
  metrics = c("sessions")  # , "pageviews"
)
```

```
#> 2019-04-05 09:33:20> Downloaded [382] rows from a total of [382].
```

```r
ggplot(data_course) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = ymd("2018-03-30", "2018-05-17", "2019-04-02"), 
             linetype = 2, color = "red") + 
  geom_point(aes(date, sessions)) + 
  bigstatsr::theme_bigstatsr()
```

<img src="network_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Here, you can clearly see three peaks of visits of [my advanced R course](https://privefl.github.io/advr38book/), one when I blogged about it, which was relayed by [R-bloggers](https://twitter.com/Rbloggers) (59K followers at the time), one other peak when [Colin Fay](https://twitter.com/_colinfay) (4600+ followers) tweeted about it, and the last peak when I tweeted about it after having finished teaching it for the second year.

### Attending conferences

To develop an international network, it is also very important to attend conferences, which I'm also trying to do.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Use bigstatsr <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> package for matrices larger than 100GB.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is me on stage in Budapest in May 2018. Before this conference, I had 118 followers on Twitter; after 3 days of conference, I had 158 (+34%).

I've also presented my work elsewhere, such as in Paris and in Denmark.

### A local network

Finally, in addition to taking part in an international community, I think it's very important to take part in a more local community. That's one reason why I launched the initiative to make an R community in Grenoble, which started to be active in September 2017. Learn more about how we organize this R group by looking at [its website](https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/).

I'm also an active member in the French community; we have been [gathering on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/r-grrr/shared_invite/enQtMzI4MzgwNTc4OTAxLWZlOGZiZTBiMWU0NDQ3OTYzOGE1YThiODgwZWNhNWEyYjI4ZDJiNmNhY2YyYWI5YzFiOTFkNDYxYzkwODUwNWM), with 450+ members.

## Retrospective thoughts

I've invested quite some time in R because I didn't want to continue in Research at first.

Now, I'm starting to switch to the "human genetics" community where I will possibly work. Maybe, I should have started earlier as it is hard to enter new research fields (since my thesis supervisors are not directly from this field).

## Conclusion

Thus, my international network is under development.

I'm using my blog (2K active users each month), Twitter (300+ followers), GitHub (150+ stars), Stack Overflow (~84K people reached) and conferences to get people to know me and want to work with me.

We can consider that it is a process that takes time, yet the indicators show that I am on the right track. 
It has already paid off for my career as I have already received 5 postdoc offers.

I'm leaving for Denmark in May to meet and work with new people. I will also be lecturer in some [Machine Learning for Health and Bioinformatics workshop](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/depts/biostatisticshealthinformatics/teaching/courses/machine-learning) at King's College London.
