# Preface {-}

## Overview {-}

In this portfolio, I show 3 competences that I'm developing:

1. Developing an international network

1. Designing teaching materials

1. Developing an expertise in Data Science

The goal is to have skills whatever I want to do next, that is working in a company or staying in Research and Academia.

## External point of view {-}

> I have read Florian Privé's portfolio and once again I have been
impressed by his achievements during his thesis. Florian was mature
enough to think about how he could develop his international network. He
has his own blog, website, he has his personal github webpage as well as
an active Twitter and Stack Overflow account. He has been very active on
social networks and has now connections all around the world, which can
be useful whatever his next career move.
>
> Florian has also designed an original teaching material online to
provide teaching about R, which is a statistical software. He started a
new course from scratch, and collected materials online. He has been
able to publish an original online advanced course about R that students
can use to learn the R software. If Florian wants to be involved in
teaching later in his career, he will build upon this previous
experience of designing an online course.
